I am writing to express my sincere apologies for the delay in delivering the task. I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, and I take full responsibility for not being able to complete the project on time.
Unfortunately, I have been overwhelmed with my current workload and have not been able to dedicate the necessary time and resources to this project.
Thank you for your understanding, and please let me know if there is anything else I can do to rectify the situation.
